String - an object that represents sequence of char values
We can create Strings by using these three classes : String (immutable), StringBuffer (mutable) and StringBuilder (mutable)

/*
Two ways to create String object:
*By string literal
*By new keyword

1) String Literal - each time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the "string constant pool" first
String s1="Welcome";
String s2="Welcome";//It doesn't create a new instance
