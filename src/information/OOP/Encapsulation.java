    // ENCAPSULATION - protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

    /*
    ADVANTAGES:
    * DATA HIDING : the user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class.
     It will not be visible to the user that how the class is storing values in the variables.
    * INCREASED FLEXIBILITY : we can make the variables of the class as read-only (getter) or write-only (setter) depending on our requirement.
    * REUSABILITY : easy to change with new requirements.
    * EASY TESTING : easy to test for unit testing.
     */

   /*
   FOUR ACCESS MODIFIERS
   * DEFAULT / PACKAGE PRIVATE - visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed
   * PRIVATE - visible to the class only
   * PUBLIC - visible to the world
   * PROTECTED - visible to the package and all subclasses
